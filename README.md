# LEDMatrixLibrary

A simple library for the Arduino platform (or other similar MCUs).

Allows the user to instantiate "matrix" objects of any size. Allows for rapid use/testing with LED matrices. 

Features:
- Multiplexing
- Display any 2d array directly
- Scrolling items on screen
- Avoids necessity of decade counter + shift register circuits

Note: this is made specifically for single-color matrices (no RGB support)
